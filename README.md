# Python-Connect-Four
A piece of work I completed for the 'Programming with Python' module in 2nd year at university. The module taught the funadamentals of Python, and for the final project we were tasked with creating a game of Connect 4. 

This code is a collection of functions which come together to run a game of connect 4 with a text-based GUI, computer opponents of 2 difficulty levels and the ability to save and load the game. 

If I could go back and do it again there are certainly a few improvements I would make: the harder difficulty opponent doesn't quite work, the save/load game feature is not fully implemented, and the play loop needs streamlining. Overall though, I am pleased with how it turned out and most importantly I learned a lot of valuable lessons from my time spent making this.
