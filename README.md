# Python-Connect-Four
A piece of work I completed for my 'Programming with Python' module in 2nd year at university. The module was intended to teach the fundamentals of
programming with python, and this piece of work was the final project of the semester. It uses a collection of functions, described within the 
code, to run a game of connect four with a visible board, 2 levels of computer opponents and the ability to save and load the game. In the end
the harder computer opponent wasn't working entirely as intended but I decided but I ran out of time to continue working on it. This was my first real
programming project so I'm sure it has plenty of flaws but nevertheless I am happy with how it turned out.
